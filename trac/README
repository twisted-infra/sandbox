PostgreSQL
==========

The trac instance has its own postgresql server.  The platform packaged
version of postgresql isn't sufficient for trac's requirements.  The server
lives beneath ~/Database/.  You can start, stop, or restart it like:

  pg_ctl <command> -D ~/Database/

You may find you need to stop trac before postgresql will shut down.

Trac
====

Trac server runs against the source in
~/.local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/Trac-0.11.6-py2.5.egg/.  This
directory is also a bzr branch.  The bzr branch has a number of
important patches checked into it.  Don't destroy or lose them.
