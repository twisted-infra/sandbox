This is the service account for the highscores website published at
<http://twistedmatrix.com/highscores/>.

RUNNING
=======
The service runs on the PyPy installed in ~pypy.

The website is published as a Twisted Web personal server.

The server may be started, if it is not running, using
~highscore/startit.sh.  The server will be automatically restarted on
reboot by a cronjob installed on the highscore account.

UPDATES
=======
The intended mechanism for updating the service is pushing new
changesets to <bzr+ssh://highscore@twistedmatrix.com/~/highscores>.

If necessary, add your public key to ~highscore/.ssh/authorized_keys

The source for the highscore server is in a bzr branch at
<~highscore/highscores>.  The branch intentionally has no working
copy.  Please do not give it one.  The branch.conf for this branch
will be overwritten with the one checked *in* to the branch on each
push.  Make changes to the checked in copy if you want them to
persist.

There is a lightweight working copy of the branch at
<~highscore/running-server-working-tree>.  The service runs against
this copy of the source.  Do not edit this copy of the source.  The
automatic updater will periodically delete this directory and replace
it with a fresh checkout.
